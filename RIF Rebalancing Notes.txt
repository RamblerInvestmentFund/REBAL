RIF Rebalancing Notes:

- Often times you'll get an error regarding the 'getSymbols' function from the quantmod library.
  This is often a result of R Studio having connection issues with the source (yahoo finance). 
  Restart your R Session/R Studio to fix this. 
  I recommend not saving your R environment for this. 

- > effFrontier <- portfolioFrontier(portfolio.returns, spec = portSpec, constraints = weights)
Error in `colnames<-`(`*tmp*`, value = names(getMu(Data))) : 
  attempt to set 'colnames' on an object with less than two dimensions

This error is giving me lots of trouble you'll have to fix it. 

HTTP Error 401: 
This basically means you've been requesting too much from Yahoo finance in a short amount of time.
Wait 1 minute, make sure the portfolio object is NULL, and re-run. 

HTTP Error 400:
This usually means the date format for the start and end date supplied from the excel document is incorrect.
Reference the template and notes from the excel document.
